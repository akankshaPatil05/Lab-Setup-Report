# Lab-Setup-Report
This repository contains my Cybersecurity Lab Setup Report completed during an internship program. The lab includes Kali Linux as the attacker machine and Metasploitable as the vulnerable target configured on a bridged adapter network. It documents installation, network setup, Linux practice, and Wireshark packet capture in a virtual environment.
